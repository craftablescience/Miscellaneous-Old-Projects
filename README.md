# Miscellaneous Old Projects
All the old programs that I could find backed up. Many have been lost to a faulty hard drive, but these remain.

## steve.py
This program is a voice assistant I made to see if I could. It worked well, except the library I used for speech-to-text was a bit unreliable. I was going to turn it into an .exe file with `py2exe` but decided to move on to other projects instead.

## sensehat_weather_monitor.py
This program uses the SenseHAT for the Raspberry Pi. It takes measurements from the various sensors onboard, and uploads them to a Dropbox folder in the cloud. It was controllable via the joystick and 8x8 LED screen on the SenseHAT. I published a tutorial on how to recreate the weather monitor at [hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/craftablescience/weather-monitor-13f9ce).

## TI-84 Formula Solvers

#### PYTHAGTH.8xp
A program that solves a Pythagorean Theorem problem for you.

#### QUADRTC2.8xp
A program that solves a Quadratic Formula problem for you. It is called "QUADRATIC 2" because I had made a program to do this before, but it was buggy and I wanted to add a feature where you could pick if the end result was before the square root operation, or after.
